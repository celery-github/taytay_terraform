For further explanation:

What if we want a new resource in dev, and not prod?
We created a turnery operator 
In the main.tf example (line 12) how it works:
For count, create one EC2 instance if it's equal to prod, BUT if it's not equal to prod then don't create anything.

Run this command ###-- terraform plan -var-file="test.tfvars"
    #nothing happens
Run this command ###-- terraform plan -var-file="prod.tfvars"
    #it creates one instance
